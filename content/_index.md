# Hi, I'm Brian. :wave:

I am a **software engineer** in Nashville, TN.

Currently, I am a Staff Software Engineer at {{< link-ext "**Thyme Care**" "https://thymecare.com/" >}}, where I lead the Platform team. Previously, I worked on software medical devices at {{<link-ext "**PathAI**" "https://www.pathai.com/" >}}.

I studied Computer Science and Biology at **Northeastern University**. I have particular interest in the field of synthetic biology, and a broader goal of using technology to improve the standard of patient care.

In my "free time," I enjoy filmmaking, live music, and building {{<link-ext "(sometimes crashing)" "https://youtu.be/CGrl7_2xaRE" >}} things.
