# Hi, I'm Brian. :wave:

I am a **computer scientist and biologist** in Boston, MA.

Currently, I am a software engineer at {{< link-ext "**Jambb**" "https://www.jambb.com/" >}}, where I lead infrastructure development. Previously, I worked on software medical devices at {{<link-ext "**PathAI**" "https://www.pathai.com/" >}}.

I studied Computer Science and Biology at **Northeastern University**. I have particular interest in the field of synthetic biology, and a broader goal of using technology to improve the standard of patient care.

In my "free time," I enjoy filmmaking, puzzle hunts, and {{<link-ext "crashing DIY quadcopters" "https://youtu.be/CGrl7_2xaRE" >}}. Most recently, I've started working with {{< link-ext "MassMesh" "https://massmesh.org/" >}}, a Boston-area organization building an equitable and community-driven alternative to traditional internet service providers.
